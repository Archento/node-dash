Setting up the server is super easy and intuitive with the 'Express-generator'. I use handlebars (and hbs) as a template engine because it has a similar syntax to ```flask Jinja``` for python which I am used to. Also one of the best free themes for making a dashboard is ColorLibs ```Adminlte```. It uses the Bootstrap framework and makes designing websites trivially easy.
